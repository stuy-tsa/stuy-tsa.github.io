                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The Technology Student Association (TSA) Achievement Program (Bronze, Silver, and Gold awards) is designed to motivate and recognize student members for high effort in a school's technology education program. The program is:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>an opportunity for every TSA member to strive and receive recognition for accomplishments.</li>
            <li>designed to encourage excellence in the areas of leadership development, understanding technology, school/community service, and career/personal planning.</li>
            <li>planned so the highest awards acknowledge outstanding individual performance.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                <p>
This noncompetitive, self-initiated program encourages students to develop appropriate attitudes and increase their knowledge and skills through involvement in technology education programs and activities.<br><br>
The goals of the TSA Achievement Program are to:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>inspire TSA members to attain the high goals and ideals of TSA.</li>
            <li>promote active participation at the school, community, state, and national levels.</li>
            <li>provide opportunities that assist students in making informed and meaningful career and educational choices.</li>
            <li>develop leadership and team participation abilities.</li>
            <li>recognize participation in technology education programs and TSA</li>
                </ul></p>
            <h2>Levels of Achievement</h2>
            <p>The TSA Achievement Program is composed of three levels of achievement: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.<br>
Each student begins at the Bronze level. When the required activities at the Bronze level are completed, s/he is eligible for the appropriate award and the opportunity to work toward achieving the Silver level.<br>
Eventually, s/he may work towards achieving the Gold level.<br>
National TSA recommends working on the Achievement Program during a two-year period. It is
suggested that students should strive to achieve the Bronze and Silver Awards in one school year, and the Gold Award during the following school year. This time frame is suggested to give the appropriate amount of time and effort to the projects/steps that are required to achieve each level and to maximize the learning experience.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To participate in the TSA Achievement Program, a student must be an active member of the Stuyvesant TSA Chapter.</li>
                    <li>The studnet must then visit the Awards Committee Head or the Chapter Vice President to obtain the forms necessary to complete the awards process.</li>
                    <li>The student may choose from the activities under the four achievement categories: Leadership Development - (LD); Understanding Technology - (UT); School/Community Service-(SC); and Career/Personal Planning (CP). These activities and their point value are listed and can be tracked on the Activity Category Forms. </li>
                    <li>The student must regularly update their form with the corresponding activities, making sure to check in weekly with the Chapter Vice President.</li>
                    <li>When a student has accumulated a minimum of 20 points in each achievement category and an additional 20 points from any or all of the categories (100 points total) s/he is eligible to complete and submit the Activity Resume. A total of 100 points is required to attain each level of achievement – Gold, Silver or Bronze.</li>
                    <li>Points are accumulated from one award level to the next. For example, points earned for the bronze award level count toward the silver award level and points earned for the bronze and silver award levels count towards the gold award level. All points earned, beginning with the bronze award must be listed on the Activity Resume each time the resume is submitted for a new level. Points may not be claimed for activities completed prior to TSA membership. Each activity may be claimed only once, unless otherwise indicated.</li>
                    <li>Once the student completes all the activities needed for the appropriate level, the student completes the Activity Resume and Submission Form, prints them out and turns them in to the chapter vice president for signature. (Note: keep a copy for your records and/or the next award level)</li>
                    <li> The Activity Resume and Submission Form must be completed in their entirety for the award level you are seeking. This includes dates, activity codes, point values, vice president’s initials and all required signatures.</li>
                    <li>The chapter advisor then verifies successful completion of the activities by signing the Activity Submission Form and submitting both the Activity Submission Form and Activity Resume to the state advisor.</li>
                    <li>Students are encouraged to retain a copy of all forms for their records.</li>
                    <li>The Stuyvesant TSA Vice President retains a copy of each student’s Activity Submission Form and Activity Resume for chapter records.</li>
                    <li>The NYSTSA state advisor verifies student’s paperwork and retains a copy of both forms for state files. No forms are submitted to the national TSA.</li>
                </ol></p>
